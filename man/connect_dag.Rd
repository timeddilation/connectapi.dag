\description{
A Connect Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a sequence of tasks to execute in Posit Connect.
Use this function to link tasks together into a single DAG.
DAGs may then be executed, which will orchestrate connect tasks.

task0 <- connect_task("task0", simulated = TRUE)
task1 <- connect_task("task1", simulated = TRUE)
task0 |> set_downstream(task1)

my_dag <- connect_dag(name = "my_dag", task0, task1)
